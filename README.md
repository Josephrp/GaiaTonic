Designed with user experience in mind, GaiaTonic offers an intuitive interface that makes it easy for anyone to access our services. Whether you are a tech-savvy farmer or a beginner in home gardening, navigating our platform is straightforward and hassle-free.

## How It Works
GaiaTonic is engineered to dynamically compile and adapt its application logic on-the-fly, ensuring a responsive and tailored user experience. The core functionality revolves around the creation, refinement, and deployment of multi-agent teams that analyze data, synthesize information, and produce multimedia outputs, including detailed analyses and visual graphs. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

**Data Input and Synthesis:** Upon receiving user-provided information, GaiaTonic initially generates synthetic data to simulate various scenarios. This approach allows for a broad analysis spectrum and the identification of optimal strategies early in the process.

**Dynamic Team Composition:** Utilizing the information and synthetic data, the application dynamically composes multi-agent teams. These teams are either predefined sets with specific expertise or are assembled on-the-fly based on the task's unique requirements.

**Analysis and Optimization:** The composed teams then proceed to refine the input prompts and data flows. This iterative process ensures the fine-tuning of analysis parameters and optimization of the advisory outputs.

**Multimedia Output Production:** Finally, the application produces comprehensive multimedia outputs. These include detailed analyses, actionable recommendations, and visual graphs, all tailored to the user's specific context and needs.

**Feedback Loop:** Users can implement the recommended strategies and continue to engage with GaiaTonic for ongoing monitoring and refinement, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptation to changing conditions.

### Data Collection: 
**Analysis:** Our multi-agent teams analyze the provided data, considering factors such as plant species, growth stage, and environmental conditions.
**Advisory:** Based on the analysis, GaiaTonic generates personalized recommendations ranging from optimization strategies for greenhouses to selecting the best crops for planting and caring for houseplants.
**Implementation:** Users can implement the advised strategies and continue to monitor progress through GaiaTonic, adjusting practices as needed based on ongoing analysis and feedback.

## Applications
**Agricultural Optimization:** Enhance crop yields and sustainability through data-driven farming practices.
**Greenhouse Automation:** Implement advanced automation techniques for efficient resource use and optimal plant growth.
**Public Health:** Promote healthier lifestyles and environments through the cultivation of green spaces and sustainable practices.
**Educational Tool:** Serve as a resource for schools and organizations to teach principles of agriculture, sustainability, and environmental science.

# Developpers

Contributions to GaiaTonic are highly encouraged, whether it's through refining existing functionalities or introducing new features. 

### Repository Structure
The GaiaTonic repository is organized into several key directories, each serving a specific function in the application's architecture:

- `/src`: The source folder containing the main application logic and subdirectories for various components.
    - `/agentics`: Contains individual agents' logic and functionalities.
    - `/teams`: Houses the logic for team composition and collaboration.
    - `/teambuilder`: Manages the dynamic assembly of agent teams.
    - `/teamgraph`: Handles the visualization and graph-based representation of team structures and data flows.
    - `/config`: Stores configuration files and environmental settings.
    - `/prompts`: Contains templates and scripts for generating and refining input prompts.
    - `/promptcompiler`: Contains the adaptive logic of GaiaTonic
    - `/plugins`: Includes additional functionalities and extensions that can be integrated into the main application.

### Contributing Guide

To maintain the integrity and organization of the codebase, contributors are asked to adhere to the following guidelines:

**Modifying Prompts:** Any changes or additions to prompts should be made within the /src/prompts directory. Ensure your modifications are clear, concise, and documented.

**Agent Graphs:** Adjustments to agent graphs, including the visualization and structural representation of data flows, should be confined to the /src/teams/teamgraph subdirectory.

**Agent Teams:** Development or refinement of agent teams must be conducted in the /src/teams/agentteams folder. When creating new teams or modifying existing ones, consider the overall application flow and how your changes might affect inter-agent dynamics.

**Individual Agents:** Work on individual agents, including their logic and functionalities, should be done inside the /src/agentics folder. Each agent should be self-contained, with a clear role and set of responsibilities within the broader application context.

**Environment Variables:** Any sensitive information or application-wide constants should be stored in a .env file at the root of the project. This includes agent IDs, API keys, and other configuration variables critical for the application's operation.

By following these guidelines, contributors can ensure their enhancements integrate smoothly with GaiaTonic's existing framework, fostering a collaborative and efficient development environment.
